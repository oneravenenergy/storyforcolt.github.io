<p><i>Story Time</i></p>
<br>
  <p>
    I’ll attempt to recall all of this in chronological order, but like I said, I have the memory of a fruit fly and there are many pieces of my life that I just don’t remember. </p>
<br>
<p>I think I started having dreams and “visits” from what I originally called “the Shadow man” when I was around six but I’m sure he was around prior to then. It started out as dreams; I had so many ridiculous, vivid dreams of what would be considered bad horror movie plots, but was never exposed to any such things at that point in life (with the exception of the movie “It” when I was 4, hence the deep-seated revulsion to clowns). The escalation started, I think, after my parents divorced and mom and I moved out on our own and I was around 12 or 13. We had moved to Missouri from Nevada (my dad stayed there). My best friend (8th grade ish) and I used to sit on the phone like all night for hours playing games online or watching TV or whatever the hell we did. A lot of the time we’d fall asleep on the phone. One night, we were both about to fall asleep and I was laying in bed and I heard a click like she had hung up, and then just silence. I think I might have said her name or something, but I got this “shock” to my head (weird impact feeling I don’t know how to describe) and then next thing I know, I was paralyzed and standing up on my bed against the wall, and this zombie-ish looking huge guy was in my room coming towards me. Can’t scream, can’t move, just stuck against the wall. That’s all I remember of that. The next morning at school I remember her being super concerned, because she said she heard the same click and then a very deep man’s voice came on the line for a second but she didn’t know what he said. She said she kept trying to call back but the line was dead. </p>
<br>
<p>Every August or thereabouts, some variant of “getting pulled over” and massively fucked up shit happening over there would occur. I kept trying to research and figure out what this was, and eventually had come to the conclusion that it was just some form of sleep paralysis (I don’t think I was ever really convinced of that). It was very similar, usually only occurred when I was sleeping on my back, always couldn’t move, couldn’t yell, and I was always fighting to get away from whatever the hell it was that was standing next to my bed. I was in Louisiana waiting to get let out of the Army when it happened again, like usual; I had fallen asleep watching some show, but got “pulled over” and I remember crawling very slowly across the floor of my room in the barracks trying to get away from the shadowy thing that I could never really see, and I flipped the light switch on (over *there*). When I came to, the light in the room was on. And that’s when it dawned on me what was actually happening.  </p>
<br>
<p>Whenever it would happen, I would be in the same place that I fell asleep and in the same position; I could see around me but everything had a haze and there was no color (because visible light spectrum isn’t a thing there). I was always interested in more “occult” things and psychic abilities when I was younger, so I had some idea of what it was like over there just by reading, but all the “astral travel” books told of these lovely, controlled experiences that didn’t include terrible demon-things trying to teach you lessons. </p>
<br>
<p>The last few times I got pulled over, I stopped fighting it and tried to talk to/interact with whatever was hanging around and not be a chicken and try to get away. After doing that a couple times, it stopped completely.  There were a couple instances in which I royally pissed them off when I was dealing with the fallout from my ex moving into my house in NV in 2013, and got pulled over and held “paralyzed” out of retribution. I eventually had enough though and put my foot down and ended their shit show carnival after my ex jumped out of bed in the middle of the night and tried to shoot the wall with the shotgun we had in the room because he saw one of them standing there (fortunately he wasn’t aware enough to flip the safety). There is more to his story that involves my watchers, but I'll save that for another time. </p>
<br>
<p>Shortly thereafter is when I finally ‘saw’ my friend; I got pulled over twice and saw what he looked like both times (couldn’t see his face though) in a much more reasonable manner, like saying “ok you’ve learned enough about things that we can be civil about this”. He told me his name and nothing else was really "spoken".</p>
<br>
 <p>Through research and having a complete mental break (dark night of the soul, if you will) a few years ago, I came to the realization that I had been essentially practicing traditional shamanism since the age of about 10. Apparently I just knew how to do my own little "rituals" and actual shamanic journeys from that age but had no clue what I was doing up until recently. All of the madness these guys have put me through in my life were really tests in preparation for ...something? I haven't figured out yet. But I am quite comfortable dealing with pretty much any possible thing that exists over there and don't need the "out of body" experience to see and manipulate things any more.</p>
